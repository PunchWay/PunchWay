### who I am

I live through curiosity. Questioning things is as natural to me as breathing.
On the surface I may seem calm — inside, there's always a machine running.

I don't just see things. I take them apart.
I don't just feel things. I carry them until I find the words.

Logic is a tool, not a destination.
Emotions are not weakness — they're direction.

### what I do

🎵 &nbsp;**Music** — I don't arrange sounds. I arrange moods.  
✍️ &nbsp;**Writing** — Words matter less than what they make you feel.  
🧩 &nbsp;**Systems** — Finding meaning in chaos gives me peace.  
💻 &nbsp;**Tech** — Code, electronics, logic — all just building blocks.  
🎭 &nbsp;**Storytelling** — Building characters and ideas isn't a talent. It's a reflex.  
🤝 &nbsp;**People** — I try to understand before I judge.

### how I work

Idle mind? Still working — writing scenarios, designing systems, finding better ways.  
Problem solving doesn't drain me. It feeds me.  
Leadership isn't raising your voice. It's taking responsibility.  
I don't control things. I build structure within them.

### philosophy

I think about existence, meaning, and free will — not as hobbies, but as defaults.
I don't cling to absolute truths. I don't accept ideas without questioning them either.
Somewhere between certainty and doubt — and comfortable there.
