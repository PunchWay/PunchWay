## `> whoami`

I live through curiosity. Questioning things is as natural to me as breathing.  
On the surface, I may seem calm — even scattered at times.  
Inside, there's always a machine running.

Logic is a tool, not a destination.  
Emotions are not weakness — they're a compass.

I don't just *see* things. I take them apart.  
I don't just *feel* things. I carry them until I find the words.

## `> ls -la /skills`

```
drwxr-xr-x  music/          → I don't arrange sounds. I arrange moods.
drwxr-xr-x  writing/        → Words matter less than what they make you feel.
drwxr-xr-x  storytelling/   → Building characters and ideas isn't a talent. It's a reflex.
drwxr-xr-x  systems/        → Finding meaning in chaos gives me peace.
drwxr-xr-x  tech/           → Code, electronics, system logic — all just building blocks.
drwxr-xr-x  people/         → I try to understand before I judge.

## `> cat values.yaml`

```yaml
curiosity:     always on
empathy:       high — sometimes a burden, always an asset
logic:         tool, not goal
leadership:    responsibility over authority
resilience:    I know how to fall. I know better how to get back up.
perfectionism: self-aware, still working on it
independence:  strong — but not isolated
```

## `> cat /mind/process.log`

```
[IDLE]     → mind finds its own task
[THINKING] → scenario written, system designed, problem reframed
[CREATING] → music / writing / code / story
[STUCK]    → overthinking... rebooting...
[BACK]     → never stays down for long

## `> philosophy --brief`

I think about existence, meaning, and free will — not as hobbies, but as defaults.  
I don't cling to absolute truths. I don't accept ideas without questioning them either.  
I sit somewhere between certainty and doubt, and I'm comfortable there.

## `> known --bugs`

```
⚠  tends to overthink
⚠  expects too much from self
⚠  goes quiet when overwhelmed
⚠  tries to solve everything alone

## `> connect`

I don't attach easily.  
But when I do — I don't stay on the surface.

If you're building something meaningful, solving something real,  
or just thinking deeply about something interesting —
